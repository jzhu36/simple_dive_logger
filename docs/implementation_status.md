## Known Issues / Technical Debt

1. ✅ ~~Unit Tests~~ - COMPLETED (62 tests passing)
2. ⏳ **Widget Tests**: End/Edit screen tests have database locking issues
3. ⏳ **Location Services**: Commented out in Begin Dive, needs re-implementation
4. ❌ **Delete Functionality**: No way to remove dives
5. ⏳ **Design System**: No theme constants file yet
6. ⏳ **Reusable Widgets**: Could extract common components (cards, buttons)
7. ⏳ **Integration Tests**: No end-to-end workflow tests
8. ⏳ **Device Testing**: Not tested on physical Android device
9. ⏳ **Error Recovery**: Some error states could be more user-friendly
10. ⏳ **Input Validation**: Could add date/time pickers instead of text fields

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Test on Android Device** - Build and test APK on physical device
2. **Re-enable GPS Location Services** - Uncomment and test in Begin Dive
3. **Build and Test APK** - Create release APK and validate workflows

### Medium Priority
4. **Add Delete Functionality** - Allow users to remove dives
5. **Add Date/Time Pickers** - Replace text fields with native pickers
6. **Fix Widget Test Database Issues** - Resolve singleton locking
7. **Add Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow validation

### Low Priority
8. **Extract Reusable Widgets** - Create common component library
9. **Create Theme Constants** - Centralize colors and styles
10. **Add Animations** - Smooth transitions between screens
11. **Performance Optimization** - Profile and optimize database queries
12. **UI Polish** - Refine spacing, colors, and visual hierarchy

- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ✅ Smart UX flows (auto-selection, dual entry points)
- ✅ 62 unit tests passing for models and services
- ✅ Support for multiple in-progress dives
- ✅ Duration auto-calculation
- ✅ Material Design 3 UI throughout
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (except delete)

**What Works**:
- Begin Dive → stores dive with timestamp

- Multiple active dives → intelligent selection UI

**Gaps**:
- ⏳ GPS location services disabled (needs re-enabling)
- ⏳ No delete functionality
- ⏳ Not tested on physical Android device
- ⏳ Widget tests have database locking issues
- ⏳ No integration tests

**Status**: Core MVP complete and functional. Ready for device testing and APK deployment.
